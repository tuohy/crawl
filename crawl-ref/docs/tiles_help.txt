                  Tiles suggestions

Crawl 0.5 renders graphics using OpenGL and SDL.  For most video cards,
this should be faster than the 0.4 version.  However, the default driver
that ships with Windows is extremely slow.  If you are having performance
problems, be sure to update your video card driver as a first step.

It has been tested successfully with cards as old as the i865.  Unfortunately,
it has been known to be slow on the i810 and there is little to be done in that
case but to run the console version instead or switch to a different machine.

You can try tweaking a number of options to see whether performance improves:

tile_title_screen = false
    For weak drivers, the title screen can take a long time to load. If this
    bothers you, you can easily deactivate it.

travel_delay = -1
    This setting suppresses redrawing until travelling is finished or
    interrupted.

tile_update_rate = 1000
    By default, the screen gets redrawn at least every 1000 milliseconds,
    more often if you take actions that change the display. You could try
    cranking up this value, though this may lead to updating taking too long.

tile_tooltip_ms = 0
    Deactivating the tooltips means there's less stuff to draw every time.

clear_map = false
    Not having to redraw remembered monsters outside your line of sight
    takes some load off the redrawing routines.

tile_window_width   = 1024
tile_window_height  = 768
    The larger the map area the more cells there are to redraw each turn.
    If you've got a large display showing way more than the necessary 17x17
    grids of the map, you could try specifying a lower resolution.
