Guide to des files
==================

des files are mostly used for creating parts of maps. Typical examples are
entry vaults or most branch ends. They are organised in four subfolders of
dat/des, namely

branches  = maps special to a branch, and branch ends
portals   = maps needed for portal vaults like labyrinths or bazaars
variable  = entry vaults, floating vaults etc.
builder   = various lua code and map snippets for technical purposes, also
            contains uniques.des and dummy.des
